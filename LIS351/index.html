        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is RaeAnna Smith and I am currently a sophomore at
        UW-Madison. I have always been an active person and played many sports
        when I was younger. In high school, I was on my school's dance team and
        loved every second of it. When I got to college, I knew I wanted to stay
        active somehow. Luckily, UW-Madison has amazing facilities that are
        easily accessible. Beginning in my freshman year, I made personal goals
        to go to the gym a few times a week. Once I got more comfortable in the
        gym, I fell in love with weight training and cardio. From there, my
        fitness journey blossomed.

        My Current Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a busy college student, I prioritize balance, but hold my fitness and
        health to a high standard. I am currently working out 6 days a week for
        one hour and incorporating one active rest day for balance and recovery.
        My goals also include drinking a gallon of water daily, and prioritizing
        proteins and fibers in my diet while remaining in a calorie deficit. I
        choose not to focus on weight, and instead focus on how my body feels!
