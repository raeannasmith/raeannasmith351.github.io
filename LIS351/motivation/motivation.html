      <h2>How I Stay Motivated</h2>
      <p>
        Staying active is definitely a challenge! I stay motivated by utilizing
        fitness and movement as
        <strong>a way to destress from my school work.</strong> If I am feeling
        overwhelmed, its easy to go on a walk or use my workouts as a study
        break.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consistency is the most important aspect if you are focused on achieving
        specific results. I stay consistent by
        <strong>following a routine.</strong> For example, I find that I workout
        better in the morning. Therefore, I workout everyday before work or
        class at around 6 a.m. and do the same type of workout depending on the
        day of the week. This eliminates any additional stress of trying to
        determine which workout to do everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working out does not have to be a negative activity! If you do not love
        working out, try to find ways to make it more enjoyable.
        <strong> I workout with friends!</strong> This makes exercising feel
        more like a social activity, and makes time go by faster.
