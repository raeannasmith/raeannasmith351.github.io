    <h2>Campus Involvement</h2>
    <p>Luckily, at UW-Madison, there are plenty of opprotunities to get involved on campus and find groups of people who enjoy fitness. Joining a club is a great way to not only meet people with similar goals, but to learn more about fitness and stay motivated.</p>

    <p>Girl Gains is one of the clubs I am involved in at UW-Madison. This club <strong>promotes female weight lifting,</strong> as gyms tend to be male domninated. It empowers women throught fitness by teaching nutrition and fitness advice at bi-weekly meetings. Additionally, the club <strong>holds many socials</strong> throughout the semester for various workouts such as <strong>classes, yoga, and zumba.</strong> Executive members and designated Small Group Workout leaders host <strong>Small Group Workouts,</strong> which are great opprotunities for new gym goers to learn new workouts and gain advice in a small group setting. It is also a great way to stay accountable with your workouts. <strong>I host small group workouts every other Friday at noon at The Nick for a leg workout.</strong> Girl Gains is <strong>free to join,</strong> and members can join anytime.</p>
